> Generates a customizable Elm application

This is largely just to replace the large boilerplate Elm repo I had.

<strike>
## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-elm-webpack using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-elm-webpack
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo elm-webpack
```
</strike>

## Installation Options

- SASS compilation (with optional SMACSS template)
- Typescript compilation with Elm Typescript Interop
- A modified elm webpack loader with a few updates since the maintainer appears to be AWOL
- Hot reloading
- SPA template
- Service Worker for caching and offline use
- PWA template
- Compression (with gzip or brotli)
